# 🫀 Heart Disease Clinical Dashboard

## 📊 Overview

This project presents a fully interactive **Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze and visualize patterns in heart disease risk using clinical patient data. It focuses on key health indicators such as cholesterol, thalassemia type, angina, and age group distribution to support insights into patient risk segmentation.

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and was preprocessed using Python for missing values, data formatting, and feature preparation. The cleaned data was then imported into Power BI to build the visual report.

## 🧠 Insights Gained

- High cholesterol levels and specific thalassemia types correlate with heart disease cases.
- The age group 50–59 showed the highest rate of heart disease in this dataset.
- Male patients showed slightly higher risk, though the sample was imbalanced.
